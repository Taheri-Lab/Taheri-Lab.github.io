### Vision
The vision of the **Taheri Lab** is to develop **computational and data-driven methods** that advance our understanding of complex biological systems and enable **predictive modeling for precision medicine**.  
We aim to bridge **machine learning**, **network science**, and **biomedical data** to support robust, interpretable, and biologically grounded discoveries in drug development and disease biology.

### Research
Our research lies at the intersection of **computational biology**, **machine learning**, and **network science**, with a strong emphasis on **biomedical applications**.

Core research directions include:
- **Drug–drug and drug–target interaction prediction**
- **Drug repurposing and polypharmacy analysis**
- **Driver gene identification and cancer module detection**
- **Biomedical knowledge graphs and heterogeneous networks**
- **Graph neural networks and deep learning for biological data**

We develop **scalable, interpretable, and biologically grounded models** that integrate molecular interactions, biological pathways, side effects, and clinical evidence.  
An overview of our research themes can be found on our [Research page](research).

### Scientific environment
The **Taheri Lab** is based at **SciLifeLab** and affiliated with **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**.  
The lab is led by **Golnaz Taheri**, Assistant Professor at KTH and **DDLS SciLifeLab and Wallenberg Fellow**.

Our research environment is highly interdisciplinary, operating at the interface of **machine learning**, **computational biology**, and **bioinformatics**.  
We combine **deep learning**, **knowledge graphs**, and **network-based approaches** to analyze large-scale biological data, with applications in **drug interaction prediction**, **drug repurposing**, and **cancer genomics**.
