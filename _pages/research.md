# Research

The **Taheri Computational Biology Lab** develops **machine learning and graph-based methods** for analyzing large-scale biological and biomedical data.  
Our work focuses on integrating **multi-omics data**, **biomedical knowledge graphs**, and **deep learning** to enable **robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant discoveries**.

At present, our research is organized around **two main directions**.

---

## 1. Computational Frameworks for Enhancing Drug Interaction Prediction and Safety

Modern drug development increasingly involves **polypharmacy**, where patients receive multiple drugs simultaneously. Predicting **drug–drug interactions (DDIs)** and **drug–target interactions (DTIs)** is therefore critical for both **efficacy** and **patient safety**.

In this research direction, we develop **graph-based deep learning frameworks** that integrate:

- Drug–drug and drug–target interaction networks  
- Biological pathways and protein–protein interaction networks  
- Side-effect and phenotypic data  
- Multi-omics profiles (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics)

By modeling drugs, targets, and biological entities as nodes in **heterogeneous knowledge graphs**, our methods aim to capture the complex molecular mechanisms underlying **drug synergy**, **adverse drug reactions**, and **off-target effects**.

Beyond interaction prediction, this work supports:
- **Drug safety assessment**
- **Pathway-level interpretation of drug effects**
- **Drug repurposing and repositioning**
- Identification of **potentially harmful drug combinations**

Ultimately, this research contributes to **safer and more reliable drug development pipelines**, with a strong emphasis on interpretability and biological relevance.

## 2. Graph-Based Learning for Biomarker Discovery in Hormone-Related Cancers

Hormone-driven cancers exhibit complex molecular heterogeneity driven by interactions across multiple biological layers.  
This research direction focuses on discovering **novel biomarkers** and **cancer modules** by combining **multi-omics data** with **graph-based machine learning**.

We integrate:
- Genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data  
- Gene–gene and protein–protein interaction networks  
- Regulatory and pathway information  

Using **graph learning**, **network representation learning**, and **deep learning models**, we aim to identify:
- **Driver genes** and **cancer-associated modules**
- Biomarkers for **diagnosis**, **prognosis**, and **treatment response**
- Potential **therapeutic targets** in hormone-related cancers

In addition to predictive performance, a key goal of this work is **biological interpretability**, enabling insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer progression and therapy resistance.

This line of research supports the development of **precision and personalized cancer care** through data-driven discovery.

## Methodological Focus

Across both research directions, we emphasize:
- Graph neural networks and representation learning  
- Knowledge graph construction and fusion  
- Multi-omics data integration  
- Interpretable and scalable deep learning models  

Our work sits at the intersection of **machine learning**, **computational biology**, and **systems biology**, with strong connections to real-world biomedical applications.
